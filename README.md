# LATTE tutorial
This is a little web app to help our team with version control when creating, distributing, and updating Instructor Sandbox courses. 

## Getting Started
To update this project, begin by forking and cloning the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the working directory, open your files in your text editor, and start the development server. You will need to install Node to run this application locally.

## What should I edit? 
If you would like to make a change to the content - a broken link, some text, an image - you can do so by editing the data that is stored in the local state of the various components. 

All of the information that we see displayed in the application comes from these different components. You can find the source code for each component by navigating to `src > components` from the root directory. Each component is stored in its own folder. All of our icons are also stored in the components folder. 

Read through the code comments to see how you can enter new data or edit the existing information. 

## How do I make my changes live?
You will need to [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) so that your changes can be reviewed and merged into the existing project.
