            <h3>What is LATTE for?</h3>
            <p>LATTE is Brandeis University's learning management system. You will use LATTE for nearly everything in your online courses:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>storing learning materials</li><li>creating, collecting, and providing feedback on assignments</li><li>communicating with students&nbsp;</li><li>linking out to external resources and learning spaces</li></ul>
            
              <h3>What will I do in this orientation?</h3>
            <p>This orientation contains a number of tasks for you to work through to get familiar with LATTE's tools - or to experiment with new ways of using them if you're already a pro. You'll use this sandbox course to learn how to add, modify, and interact with the suite of tools available to you through LATTE.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Before you begin, there are a few things you should know how to do.</h3>
            <p>We'll cover some of the basics of interacting with resources, activities, and students, but there are a few foundational concepts about LATTE that you should become familiar with first. Click through each link to learn about how to set up your profile (let students get to know you), upload a profile picture (and see you), and make your class available and accessible to students. You can also learn about some cool tricks (like how to preview what your course will look like to students). Be sure you're familiar with these foundational concepts before you move on to working on the tasks.</p>

            <h3>I have the basics set up. What do I do now?</h3>
          <p>If you scroll down on your page, you'll see four sections, guiding you through a series of tasks to complete to get you acclimated to LATTE. Make your way through each task before moving to the next section. Each section contains a place for you to add resources or interact with activities. Some of the tasks will entail creating activities and resources, while others will be learning about how you would do things that involve students (like creating groups, for instance) in an actual class. For a couple of tasks, you'll need to navigate to another section of LATTE to complete a task. You will see instructions on where to go to complete the task in the "Practice Here" sub-section.</p>
          <p>At the very end of this page, you'll find a section called "Your Experimental Space." This is a blank topic where you can try out any tools not covered in this tutorial, or play with different layouts you might want to try in your course. Remember: this sandbox course cannot be copied to your course website, so any work you do here will not transfer to an actual course.</p>
